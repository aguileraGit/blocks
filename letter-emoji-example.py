Emoji example. Font must be downloaded and placed in the same directory.
See: https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji?query=Noto+E

Emojis don't function like normal text. Some emojis are actually 2 or maybe
more characters. They also don't seem to render correctly. See examples below.

#Convert text to a list. Adds space in first location

    #Update letter
    blk.text = letter

    #Create block
    blk.createBlockHelper()

    #Export as STL
